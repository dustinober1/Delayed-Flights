## Actionable Insights

### For Airlines:
1. **Schedule Optimization**: Consider reducing evening departure slots or building in buffer time
2. **Route Management**: Focus improvement efforts on consistently problematic routes
3. **Hub Operations**: Implement better ground operations at high-delay airports

### For Passengers:
1. **Best Travel Times**: Book morning flights and avoid Wednesday/Friday travel when possible
2. **Airport Selection**: Consider alternative airports to avoid FLL, LAS, MCO during peak times
3. **Airline Choice**: Consider delay history when booking, especially for leisure travel

### For Airport Operations:
1. **Capacity Planning**: Evening hours require enhanced operations management
